# Windows Server

### What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?
- A server is a specialized computer designed to provide services, data, or resources to other devices on a network. It differs from a regular computer in that it's optimized for running specific server-related tasks, such as hosting websites, managing databases, or handling network traffic, while a regular computer is typically used for individual user tasks like web browsing, document editing, etc.

#### How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?
- Windows Server typically receives updates through the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC), offering stability with less frequent updates, focusing more on security and critical fixes. In contrast, Windows Home and Pro editions often receive updates through the Semi-Annual Channel (SAC), providing more frequent feature updates along with security fixes and improvements.

#### Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?
- Yes, Windows Server generally has higher hardware requirements compared to Windows Home or Pro editions due to its server-oriented tasks. It typically needs more powerful processors, greater RAM, and additional storage capacity to handle server-specific functions efficiently.
