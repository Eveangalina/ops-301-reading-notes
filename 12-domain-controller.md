# Windows Domain and how it affects my PC

### Explain the role of a Domain Controller?
- A Domain Controller (DC) is a server that manages security authentication requests within a Windows domain. It stores user account information, including usernames, passwords, and access rights, in a centralized database known as Active Directory. 


### What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?
-  It streamlines user management, reduces the need for multiple passwords, and enhances productivity. However, the security risks include a single point of failureâ€”if the credentials are compromised, an attacker could gain access to multiple systems across the domain.

### Describe how group policies are used in domains?
- Group policies in domains allow administrators to manage and configure settings for multiple users and computers centrally. 


### In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading?
- Resource sharing and access control, remote access and VPNs.
