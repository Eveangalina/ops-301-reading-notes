# What is Active Directory
### What exactly is “Active Directory” and are the key services it provides?
- Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft tool used to manage users, computers, and resources within a network. Its key services include Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for user and resource management, Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) for specific applications, Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) for security certificates, Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) for identity sharing, and Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) for controlling access to documents and data.
### What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory?
- A domain is a group of objects with the same Active Directory database (e.g., company.com).
- A tree consists of linked domains sharing a common namespace.
- A forest includes multiple trees sharing a common schema but not a contiguous namespace.
### How can objects (e.g. users, devices) within a domain be grouped?
- Objects within a domain in Active Directory can be grouped using Organizational Units (OUs). 
- Organizational Units are containers within a domain that allow administrators to organize and manage objects, such as users, computers, groups, and other OUs themselves. OUs help in simplifying administrative tasks by grouping similar objects together based on functional, geographical, or departmental structures within an organization. 
- This grouping enables administrators to apply specific policies, permissions, and settings to the objects contained within each OU.
### Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.
- Active Directory is like a master organizer for our computer network at home. It helps keep everything in order by managing who can access which parts of our network. Just like a big file cabinet where we organize different folders for different things, Active Directory organizes who can use which computer, access specific files, or even use certain apps on our home network. It also makes it easier for us to control and manage who gets to do what on our family computers, which keeps our information safe and helps everything run smoothly.
