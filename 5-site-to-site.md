# Site-to-Site VPN

### What is a site-to-site VPN?
-  A site-to-site VPN establishes encrypted connections between multiple locations or networks, allowing secure communication over the internet. It creates a virtual encrypted tunnel between the sites, enabling data to be transmitted securely as if the sites were directly connected on a private network.


### What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) manages data transmission by ensuring reliable and ordered delivery, while IP (Internet Protocol) handles addressing and routing of data packets across networks, forming the basis for internet communication. 
- TCP/IP outlines how data is organized according to packets, given addresses, transmitted, and received across different computers on the internet.
