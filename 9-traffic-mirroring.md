# SPAN vs TAP

#### What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?
- The key distinctions lie in their location, operation, and reliability. SPAN operates within network switches, selectively copying traffic based on configurations, while TAP is an independent device that captures all network traffic directly, ensuring a more reliable copy but possibly at a higher cost and requiring separate setup.


#### What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?
- Devices like switches, routers, and special network tools can do traffic mirroring. But not every device has this feature. 

#### How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?
- It enhances network security
- <u> Finding Problems:</u> It helps to quickly see if something bad is happening in the network, like someone trying to break in.<br>
<u> Investigating Issues:</u>  When there's a problem, looking at the mirrored traffic can help find out what exactly happened.<br>
<u> Stopping Attacks: </u> It helps to catch strange things happening in the network and stop them before they cause damage.



#### Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?
- Privacy: Sometimes, the mirrored traffic might have private info. Make sure to follow rules. It's important to let people know if their network is being watched. Get their permission if needed.
Keep sata safe and away from any foul play.
