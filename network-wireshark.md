Layers of OSI Model

Q: What does “OSI” stand for?
A: Open Systems Interconnection (OSI).

Q: List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.
A: 
1. Application Layer: 
2. Presentation Layer:
3. Session Layer:
4. Transport Layer: 
5. Network Layer: Routing data packets across a network. 
6. Data Link Layer: error free data transfer over a physical link. This layer is divided into two sublayers which are; 
the Logical Link Control (LLC) and the Media Access Control (MAC). This layer is responsible for framing, physical addressing, error and flow control, as well as access control. 
7. Physical Layer: lowest layer, is responsible for transmitting raw data bits accross a physical medium; from one node to the next. Functions of this layer include bit synchonization, rate control, physical topologies, and transmission mode. 

Q: Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?
Q: How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?
